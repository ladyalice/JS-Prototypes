/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Window / Global binding - when in the global scope 'this' will be the value of the window / console Object
  (aka: All of JS is an object!! The browser runs it.)
  2. Implicit binding - you imply that the object to the left of the dot is what "this" is referring to
  3. Explicit binding - call, apply, and bind - these are ways to tell the function directly what it is by passing 
  it in when it's invoked. 
  .call- you pass the arguments in one by one.
  .apply - you pass in arguments as an array and it is invoked immediately. You can pass in an array.
  .bind - you pass in the argument, but it isn't invoked immediately, it creates a new function that can be called later.
  4. New Binding using the 'new' keyword creates a new object and 'this' points to the new object.
  when a function is invoked as a constructor function, the 'new' keyword 'this' points to the object that is created
