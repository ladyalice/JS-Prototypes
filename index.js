  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

//create an eat functionthat gives the person the ability
//to eat, so it has a parameter of something that we can pass food into as an argument

//if stomach length < 10, the person can eat
// we want to push arguments to the new array

  TASK 2
    - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.

        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Window / Global binding - when in the global scope 'this' will be the value of the window / console Object
  (aka: All of JS is an object!! The browser runs it.)
  2. Implicit binding - you imply that the object to the left of the dot is what "this" is referring to
  3. Explicit binding - call, apply, and bind - these are ways to tell the function directly what it is by passing 
  it in when it's invoked. 
  .call- you pass the arguments in one by one.
  .apply - you pass in arguments as an array and it is invoked immediately. You can pass in an array.
  .bind - you pass in the argument, but it isn't invoked immediately, it creates a new function that can be called later.
  4. New Binding using the 'new' keyword creates a new object and 'this' points to the new object.
  when a function is invoked as a constructor function, the 'new' keyword 'this' points to the object that is created
